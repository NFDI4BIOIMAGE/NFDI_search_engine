# NFDI Search Engine

This repository is dedicated to enhancing the search functionality of the NFDI4BioImage training website by collecting and organizing training materials and related resources.

## Overview

The project leverages several key technologies:

- **[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html)**: For indexing and searching materials.
- **[React](https://react.dev/learn)**: As the frontend framework for building a user-friendly interface.
- **[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/)**: Serving as the backend API to manage interactions with the database and Elasticsearch.
- **[Scroll API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/scroll-api.html)**: Used to efficiently handle large datasets during search queries.
- **[NFDIBIOIMAGE Assistant](https://scads.github.io/generative-ai-notebooks/20_chatbots/10_chatbot.html)**: Helps researchers find relevant resources.
- **[KISSKI LLM](https://scads.github.io/generative-ai-notebooks/15_endpoint_apis/06_kisski_endpoint.html)**: Powers intelligent chatbot responses.
- **[Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://scads.github.io/generative-ai-notebooks/60_rag/20-simple-rag.html)**: Provides context-aware answers.

## Quick Start with Docker

To simplify the setup process, the project is containerized with Docker. Follow these steps to get the search engine up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

1. **GitHub API Key or Token**: The search engine requires access to GitHub for submitting and managing materials. Ensure that you have set up the necessary GitHub API keys or tokens on your machine.
   - You can refer to this [website](https://nfdi4bioimage.github.io/training/contributing/submit_app.html) for instructions on how to set up the API key or token.
   - This key/token should be securely stored and added to the necessary environment variables on your machine.

2. **KISSKI API Key**: To enable the NFDIBIOIMAGE Assistant to interact with the KISSKI LLM service, you need to configure your KISSKI API key. Follow these steps to set it up:

   #### Step 1: Obtain a KISSKI API Key
    - Visit the official KISSKI LLM service page: [KISSKI LLM Service](https://services.kisski.de/services/en/?service=2-02-llm-service.json).
    - Register or log in to access the service.
    - Once registered, generate your **KISSKI API key** from the email.

   #### Step 2: Set Up the API Key in the Project
    - Open the project directory in your preferred code editor.
    - Locate the `.env` file in the root of the project. If the file doesn't exist, create a new one.
    - Replace `your_kisski_api_key_here` with the API key you obtained from KISSKI in your `.env` file:
        ```plaintext
        KISSKI_API_KEY=your_kisski_api_key_here
        ```
    - Save the `.env` file.

3. **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)** and **[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)** installed on your machine.

4. **Currently, this project is only supported on Windows.**

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NFDI4BIOIMAGE/nfdi_search_engine.git
   ```
   ```bash
   cd nfdi_search_engine
   ```

2. Locate the `docker-compose.yml` file in the project directory.

3. Build and start the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

This command will pull all necessary images, build the project, and start the containers.

4. **Important**: After the initial setup, when you start the containers again by clicking the **Start** button in Docker Desktop, you will need to wait approximately **37 seconds** for Elasticsearch and the Chatbot's LLM service to fully initialize before the search engine and chatbot become accessible.


## Accessing the Application

Once the Docker containers are running, you can access the application:

1. **Search Engine Interface**: Visit 'http://localhost:3000' to access the search engine. Youâ€™ll find a user-friendly interface that allows you to search and browse a variety of training materials related to bioimage analysis.
